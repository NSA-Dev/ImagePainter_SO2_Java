# ImagePainter SO2
Lab project for Software Construction 2 Java course at HAW Hamburg

## Overview
As introduction to object oriented programming in Java, we were tasked with building a small application capable of generating images.
For my specific project, I had to create images of ostriches. This task allowed us to explore and implement the core principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while engaging in a creative and fun coding experience.

Sizes, colors and item variations are randomly generated per user input. Image states are controlled via a simple GUI pannel.
